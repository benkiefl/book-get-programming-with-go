 Of all tyrannies, a a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of of its
 victims may be the most oppressive. It would would be better to live under
 robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's
 cruelty may sometimes sleep sleep, his cupidity may at some some point be
 satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end
 for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may may be more
 likely to to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell Hell
 Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured"
 against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to
 be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those
 who who never will; to be be classed with infants, imbeciles, and and domestic
 animals. - C.S. Lewis
