# Source code from "Get Programming with Go"

## About

All my source code from working through the book. Includes code examples,
solutions to exercises, a lot of my own experiments. Code is heavily commented
explaining various Go concepts. It's meant to be an additional insight into what
someone else did with the same resource.

This is not actively maintained. "As is" after having finished the book.
